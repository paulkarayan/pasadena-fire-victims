Friend of David Gross:

Our family home of over 30 years burned down along with much of Altadena in the Eaton fire. Our family is safe. We are helping our parents with whatever the next phase of their life entails. If you'd like to support us as we begin, any help is so appreciated.

-Molly, Oren and Elah
